Pulled rabbitmq image for docker
docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management

access management tool via localhost:15672

Default username and pass is guest

Consume happens for this app when consumer queue name matches with rabbitmq's queue name

I had to manually create the queues...As the codes was not creating them

But the queues can be created using spring codes.

There was no exchange explicitly coded.(Default exchange was used)

queue consumption is not synchrnous.
production seemed synchronous.

if production pushes message to queue and there is no consumer then the messages stay there
When a consumer arrives it takes the messages from queues
